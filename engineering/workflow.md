# Project Management
We follow a lightweight ceremoniless agile framework called [Flights](https://simonhoiberg.medium.com/the-flight-manual-9e1aedd04fbf).

## Feedback 
Feedback and opportunity areas should be shared continuously. Team members are also encouraged to share feedback at the conclusion of a flight.

## Stand up
We have daily async standups on discord facilitated by a discord bot. 

# Creating a New Github Repo
When possible, new repos should be public due to our [transparency value](https://github.com/porter-finance/handbook/blob/main/values/transparency.md).

* When setting up a new repo mimic the branch rules from our [Handbook](https://github.com/porter-finance/handbook/settings/branches). 
* Enable [Auto Merge](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/configuring-pull-request-merges/managing-auto-merge-for-pull-requests-in-your-repository)
