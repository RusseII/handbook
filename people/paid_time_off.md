# Paid Time Off
As we all work remotely it can sometimes be difficult to know when and how to plan time off. Here is some advice and guidance on how this can be done in an easy and collaborative way.
1. We have a "no ask, must tell" time off policy. This means that:
    * What we care about are your results, not how long you work. While you don't need to ask approval for time off, it shouldn’t be at the expense of business getting done. Please coordinate with your team before taking time off, especially during popular or official holidays, so that we can ensure business continuity.  We want to ensure we have adequate coverage and avoid situations where all/most of the team is taking time off at the same time.
    * When taking time off make sure your manager is aware of your absence. Giving your manager and team members a heads up early helps them prioritize work and meet business goals and deadlines.
    * It can be helpful to take longer breaks to re-energize. If this is helpful to you, we strongly recommend taking at least two consecutive weeks of time off per year.
1. We don't frown on people taking time off, but rather encourage people to take care of themselves and others by having some time away. If you notice that your co-worker is working long hours over a sustained period, you may want to let them know about the time off policy.
1. In addition, we encourage all team members to take time off for holidays they observe. Porter embraces asynchronous communications, so calls can be recorded and watched later. No one should ever be expected to attend calls on days they are not working or on official public holidays. 
1. Not taking vacation is viewed as a weakness and people shouldn't boast about it. It is viewed as a lack of humility about your role, not fostering collaboration in training others in your job, and not being able to document and explain your work. You are doing the company a disservice by being a single point of failure. The company must be able to go for long periods without you. We don't want to lose you permanently by you burning yourself out by not taking regular vacations.
1. You don't need to worry about taking time off to go to the gym, [take a nap](https://m.signalvnoise.com/sleep-deprivation-is-not-a-badge-of-honor-f24fbff47a75), go grocery shopping, do household chores, help someone, take care of a loved one, etc. If you have urgent tasks, but something comes up or takes longer than expected, just ensure the rest of the team **knows** and someone can pick up the tasks (assuming you're able to communicate).
1. It's important to take PTO while you have something you *want* to do, rather than waiting until you *need* the time off.

### Communicating Your Time Off

Communicate broadly when you will be away so other people can manage time efficiently, projects don't slip through the cracks, and so that you don't get bothered while away.
1. Consider using [Google Calendar's "out of office" setting](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/7638168?hl=en) (scroll down to "Show when you’re out of office") to create an out of office event that will automatically decline new and existing meetings for you.
1. Decline any meetings you will not be present for so the organizer can make appropriate arrangements.
    * Cancel, move, or find coverage for any meetings for which you are the organizer.
1. It may be useful to share your planned time off as a **FYI** on your team's Discord channel(s)
1. Transition and reassign work that is already in progress to another member of your team whenever possible.
1. Please document your knowledge and share it with others. [Key-person-risk](https://dynamicbusiness.com.au/topics/workplace/hr-and-staff/managing-key-person-risk.html) can have a large impact. This is especially true for "subject matter experts" or SME, people with specialized knowledge of a project, tool, or subject.
    1. It can be very helpful for your PTO and team members if you document, share (async in Discord) and communicate your PTO already well in advance (2-3 weeks). 
    1. One useful way of capturing work is to create & share a Google Doc which lists all your important projects / customer interactions + a short list of useful details per entry. This include tips for covering you best while on PTO. For example:
        1. "Name of covering team member" - also useful for your manager to quickly know who is covering which projects or customers for you.
        1. "Attendance in calls/zoom sessions required while on PTO" - Teammates can already start to plan and free up time in their calendar for specified dates/times.
        1. "High Priority Topics" - List of topics and/or links to issues which are most relevant while you are on PTO.
        1. "Comments by covering team member" - Very useful to asynchronously get updates quickly when you return from your PTO.
        1. Pro tip: Use color codes (e.green, red), to let others easily & quickly identify most important entries. 


### Returning from PTO

Returning from PTO of any length can feel overwhelming. Consider implementing these strategies when returning from time off in order to make the most of the rest and reflection you've achieved.

1. Remember that it's normal to take extra time to catch up after returning from paid time off. Taking time off doesn't mean that you need to work extra hours before or after your vacation. When taking extended time off, expect to have reduced capacity to take on new work the week of your return while you're catching up on the work that happened while you were away. 

1. Honor a window of transition when returning from PTO and recognize that rest and time off is productive. Big, reflective moments may happen when you take a step back and reflect. Before catching up on all missed emails and Discord messages, consider first revisiting priority projects to take action on these reflections.
